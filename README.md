## Introduction

A **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** is a statistical model used to represent systems that are Markov processes with unobservable (hidden) states. In simpler terms, it's a model where the system being modeled transitions between various states, but these states are not directly visible to the observer. Instead, each hidden state generates observable outputs (also known as emissions), which we can see.

The HMM is widely used in areas such as speech recognition, bioinformatics, and natural language processing.

## Core Concepts of HMM

An HMM is defined by the following components:

### States
- The system can be in one of several discrete **states** at any time. However, the state itself is hidden, meaning that we do not directly observe the state.
- The states form a **Markov chain**, where the probability of transitioning to the next state depends only on the current state.

### Observations
- While the states are hidden, they produce **observations** (or emissions) that are visible. These observations are probabilistically related to the hidden states.
  
### Transition Probabilities
- These define the probability of moving from one state to another. If the system is in state `i` at time `t`, the probability that it will transition to state `j` at time `t+1` is given by `A[i][j]`.

### Emission Probabilities
- These define the probability of observing a particular output (observation) from a specific hidden state. The emission probability is represented as `B[i][o]`, which indicates the likelihood of observing `o` while being in state `i`.

### Initial Probabilities
- The **initial probability distribution** `π` gives the probabilities of the system starting in each state. For example, `π[i]` is the probability that the system starts in state `i`.

## Three Fundamental Problems

HMMs solve three key problems that make them useful in real-world applications:

### 1. Likelihood Computation (Forward Algorithm)

**Problem**: Given a sequence of observations, compute the probability that they were generated by the model.

This is the problem of evaluating how well a given HMM explains an observed sequence of events. The **Forward Algorithm** efficiently calculates this by recursively summing over all possible hidden states that could have produced the observations.

### 2. Decoding (Viterbi Algorithm)

**Problem**: Given a sequence of observations, what is the most likely sequence of hidden states that could have produced them?

The **Viterbi Algorithm** is a dynamic programming approach to find the most probable sequence of hidden states. It uses backtracking to decode the hidden states based on the observed outputs.

### 3. Learning (Baum-Welch Algorithm)

**Problem**: Given a set of observed data, how can we estimate the parameters of the HMM (i.e., the transition, emission, and initial probabilities)?

The **Baum-Welch Algorithm**, a special case of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, is used to train the model by iteratively adjusting the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed sequences.

## Use Cases

1. **Speech Recognition**: HMMs are used to model sequences of spoken words and predict the most likely word based on speech sounds.
  
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: HMMs are used for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition by modeling the sequence of words and their categories.

3. **Bioinformatics**: HMMs are applied to DNA sequence analysis, especially in finding gene sequences in genomic data.

4. **Finance**: HMMs help model market behaviors where the market state is hidden, but prices and trading activities are observable.
